## Objective

To identify the stability across time of the 24 hour price time series cluster structure, given publicly available 5mn electricity prices (price in column C)
More precisely, define a 6 month period, identify the 24 hour price time series cluster structure over that period with 6 clusters.
Repeat after shifting the 6 month period by 1 week.
Create and plot 6 time series corresponding to the number of components belonging to each of the 6 clusters over time (each series will have 26 numbers corresponding to the number of times the 6 month period can be shifted within a year).
